===========================================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS® use cases.

This use case shows how RTI Connext Professional can be integrated with the Unreal Engine to create a dynamic visualization of DDS Data using the Shapes Application. The Tutorial folder contains the resulting UNreal Engine workspace of the Case + Code. The use case shows examples and different ways of how RTI COnnext can be into Unreal Engine 4.

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real distributed applications based on RTI Connext. The example describes how external and real life data can be used within an Unreal Engine workspace. Additional information about this use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/unreal-gaming).


RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
