===========================================

*Case + Code* Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of **Real-Time Innovations**' *Case + Code* project, a project to create code for real-world **RTI Connext DDS®** use cases.

This use case shows how **RTI Connext DDS Professional** can be integrated with the **Unreal Engine** to create a dynamic visualization of **DD**S data using the *RTI DDS Shapes Demo* application. The "Tutorial" folder contains the resulting **Unreal Engine** workspace of the *Case + Code*. The use case shows examples and different ways of how **RTI Connext** can be into **Unreal Engine**.

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real distributed applications based on **RTI Connext**. The example describes how external and real life data can be used within an **Unreal Engine** workspace. A step-by-step, video tutorial can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/unrealengine-sim).

Also, there is another example in GitHub that has some basic C++ defined components that are easier to modify or extend to use your own datatypes for your own applications.  Please see:

**RTI Connext DDS** Overview
------------------------
**RTI Connext DDS** software includes the world's leading implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) **Data Distribution Service** (**DDS**). **DDS** is the only open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
