 RTI Connext DDS Use Case: Simulate an Immersive Environment using Real-Time Data with Unreal Engine®
=====================================

## Overview
This repository contains examples of using RTI Connext® with the Unreal Engine. This folder contains the completed Unreal Engine workspace from the Simulate an Immersive Environment using Real-Time Data with Unreal Engine® Case + Code. 

The example in the step-by-step, video tutorial on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/unrealengine-sim) was created using Unreal Engine 4.25.3 and RTI Connext Professional 6.0.1.

However, since those versions of Unreal Engine and RTI Connext are quite old, this repository has been updated to work with Unreal Engine 5.6.1 and RTI Connext Professional 7.6.0.  You should be able to open the Unreal project with the Unreal Editor from 5.6.1 and compile and run with RTI Connext Pro 7.6.0.

If you want to download the version of this repository that corresponds to the video tutorial, please check out the branch "feature/connext.6.0-unreal.4.25"

Also, there is another example that has some basic C++ defined components that are easier to modify or extend to use your own datatypes for your own applications.  Please see:
